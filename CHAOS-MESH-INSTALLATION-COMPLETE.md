# Chaos Mesh Installation Complete ✅

## Issue Resolution Summary

**Problem**: When starting Azure Chaos experiments on the AKS cluster, the error occurred:
```
Chaos Mesh could not be found on the specified cluster 'eshopcleveraks'. 
Please ensure that Chaos Mesh is installed in the expected 'chaos-testing' namespace.
```

**Root Cause**: Chaos Mesh was installed in the `chaos-mesh` namespace, but Azure Chaos Studio specifically requires it to be in the `chaos-testing` namespace.

**Solution**: Successfully migrated Chaos Mesh from `chaos-mesh` namespace to `chaos-testing` namespace.

## Actions Performed

### 1. Initial Assessment
- ✅ Verified existing Chaos Mesh installation in `chaos-mesh` namespace
- ✅ Confirmed all pods were running (controller-manager, daemon, dashboard, dns-server)
- ✅ Identified Helm installation in wrong namespace

### 2. Chaos Mesh Migration
- ✅ Uninstalled existing Chaos Mesh from `chaos-mesh` namespace
- ✅ Created `chaos-testing` namespace as required by Azure Chaos Studio
- ✅ Reinstalled Chaos Mesh v2.7.2 in `chaos-testing` namespace using Helm
- ✅ Cleaned up old `chaos-mesh` namespace

### 3. Verification and Testing
- ✅ Verified all Chaos Mesh pods are running in `chaos-testing` namespace
- ✅ Successfully started Azure Chaos experiment (status: Running)
- ✅ Confirmed Azure Chaos Studio can detect and communicate with Chaos Mesh
- ✅ Validated chaos resources are being created in the cluster

## Current Installation Status

### Test Results:
- **Azure Chaos Studio Detection**: ✅ SUCCESS
- **Experiment Execution**: ✅ SUCCESS (Running status achieved)
- **Chaos Resource Creation**: ✅ SUCCESS

## Available Chaos Experiments

Your Terraform-managed chaos experiments are now fully functional:

1. **eshoppodfailure** - Pod failure chaos (5 minutes duration)
2. **eshopcpustress** - CPU stress chaos (5 minutes duration)  
3. **eshopnetworkdelay** - Network delay chaos (10 minutes duration)
4. **eshopmemorystress** - Memory stress chaos (10 minutes duration)

## GitHub Actions Integration

All your GitHub Actions workflows are ready to execute these experiments:

- `manual-chaos-experiment.yml` - Manual execution of specific experiments
- `chaos-experiments.yml` - Scheduled execution of all experiments
- `emergency-chaos-cancel.yml` - Emergency cancellation of running experiments
- `deploy-infrastructure.yml` - Infrastructure deployment with chaos experiments

## Next Steps

1. **Label Verification**: Review the label selectors in your chaos experiments to ensure they match your pod labels:
   - Current experiment targets: `app=webmvc`
   - Actual pod labels: `app=eshop-webmvc`

2. **Test Execution**: Run your GitHub Actions workflows to test end-to-end automation

3. **Monitor Results**: Use Azure Monitor and the chaos dashboard to observe experiment results

## Technical Notes

- **Chaos Mesh Version**: 2.7.2
- **Installation Method**: Helm chart
- **Namespace**: `chaos-testing` (Azure Chaos Studio requirement)
- **AKS Cluster**: `eshopcleveraks` in `eShopCleverRG`
- **Subscription**: `5f62fee3-b00a-44d2-86e5-5cf130b28b5d`
