# Chaos Experiments for eShopOnWeb AKS Testing
# Use these experiments to test Azure SRE Agent response

## ðŸŽ¯ Experiment 1: Pod Chaos - Kill all eShop pods
### This will kill all pods in the eshop namespace to test application resilience

**JSON Spec for Pod Chaos:**
```json
{"action":"pod-failure","mode":"all","selector":{"namespaces":["eshop"]}}
```

**Expected Impact:**
- All eShop application pods will be terminated
- Kubernetes will automatically restart them
- Users will experience temporary service interruption
- Test: Azure SRE Agent should detect the outage and provide alerts

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Experiment 2: Stress Chaos - High CPU load on Web MVC
### This will create high CPU load on Web MVC pods

**JSON Spec for Stress Chaos:**
```json
{"mode":"all","selector":{"namespaces":["eshop"],"labelSelectors":{"app":"eshop-webmvc"}},"stressors":{"cpu":{"workers":4,"load":95}}}
```

**Expected Impact:**
- Web MVC pods will experience 95% CPU load
- Response times will increase significantly
- Users may experience slow page loads
- Test: Azure SRE Agent should detect performance degradation

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Experiment 3: Network Chaos - Network delays
### This will add network delays to all eshop pods

**JSON Spec for Network Chaos:**
```json
{"action":"delay","mode":"all","selector":{"namespaces":["eshop"]},"delay":{"latency":"2s","correlation":"100","jitter":"0ms"}}
```

**Expected Impact:**
- All network traffic to/from eshop pods will have 2-second delays
- Database connections will be slower
- Inter-service communication will be affected
- Test: Azure SRE Agent should detect latency issues

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Experiment 4: IO Chaos - Disk I/O failures
### This will cause I/O failures in application pods

**JSON Spec for IO Chaos:**
```json
{"action":"fault","mode":"all","selector":{"namespaces":["eshop"]},"errno":5,"percent":50,"path":"/app"}
```

**Expected Impact:**
- 50% of file operations will fail
- Application may crash or behave unpredictably
- Log files and temporary files will be affected
- Test: Azure SRE Agent should detect application failures

## ðŸš€ How to Create Experiments in Azure Portal

### Step 1: Navigate to Chaos Studio
1. Go to: https://portal.azure.com
2. Search for "Chaos Studio"
3. Click on "Chaos Studio"

### Step 2: Create New Experiment
1. Click "Experiments" â†’ "Create" â†’ "New experiment"
2. Fill in:
   - **Subscription**: Patrocinio de Microsoft Azure
   - **Resource Group**: eShopCleverRG
   - **Location**: East US
   - **Name**: (e.g., "eShop-Pod-Chaos-Test")

### Step 3: Configure Experiment
1. In Experiment Designer:
   - **Step Name**: "Break eShop Pods"
   - **Branch Name**: "Pod Failure"
   - **Action**: "Add fault"
   
2. Select fault type:
   - **AKS Chaos Mesh Pod Chaos** (for pod failures)
   - **AKS Chaos Mesh Stress Chaos** (for CPU/memory stress)
   - **AKS Chaos Mesh Network Chaos** (for network issues)
   - **AKS Chaos Mesh IO Chaos** (for I/O failures)

3. Configure fault:
   - **Duration**: 5 (minutes)
   - **jsonSpec**: Copy one of the JSON specs above

### Step 4: Select Target
1. Click "Target resources"
2. Select your AKS cluster: **eshopcleveraks**
3. Click "Next"

### Step 5: Grant Permissions
1. After creating experiment, go to your AKS cluster
2. Navigate to "Access control (IAM)"
3. Click "Add" â†’ "Add role assignment"
4. Select "Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster Admin Role"
5. Search for your experiment name and assign it

### Step 6: Run Experiment
1. Go back to Chaos Studio
2. Select your experiment
3. Click "Start experiment"
4. Monitor the results and Azure SRE Agent responses

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring During Experiments

### What to Monitor:
1. **Application Availability**: http://20.253.117.38
2. **Pod Status**: `kubectl get pods -n eshop`
3. **Application Logs**: `kubectl logs -n eshop -l app=eshop-webmvc`
4. **Azure Monitor**: Check for alerts and metrics
5. **Azure SRE Agent**: Look for automated responses and recommendations

### Expected Azure SRE Agent Responses:
- **Incident Detection**: Should detect service degradation
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Should identify chaos-induced issues  
- **Recommendations**: Should suggest mitigation steps
- **Automated Actions**: May attempt self-healing actions

---

## ðŸ”„ Recovery Verification

After each experiment:
1. Verify application returns to normal: `kubectl get pods -n eshop`
2. Test application functionality: http://20.253.117.38
3. Check all pods are healthy and running
4. Review Azure SRE Agent logs and actions taken
